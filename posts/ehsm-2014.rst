We will be giving a talk at this year's `Exceptionally Hard & Soft Meeting (EHSM) <http://www.ehsm.eu/>`_.

In the talk, we will present the physics of walking and how a successful walking machine can be built, at least in simulation. We will then discuss our plans for moving from simulation to actual hardware.

We also plan to bring the :doc:`acrobot`, hopefully finished by then.

See you there!
